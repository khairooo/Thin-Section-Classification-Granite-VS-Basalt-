# Thin-Section-Classification-Granite-VS-Basalt-

- This project is considered as Combination Petrographique (microscopique) Studies and Deep learning CNN model
- I attempted to make the project legible for any Geologist, Geoscientist who wants to build a similar project probably for the thesis our any other research  
- Adding some techniques like 'Data Augmentation' to produce more Data in case where there is a limited access, or lack of Datasets
- Simple explanation and links to some used concepts throughtout the project
