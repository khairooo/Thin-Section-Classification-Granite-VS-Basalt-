# Thin-Section-Classification-Granite-VS-Basalt

- This project is a Deep Learning classifcation module for Granite and Basalt, using Microscopique (thin section) images.
- I attempted to make the project legible for Geologists, Geoscientists who want to build a similar project for their thesis or within any research.
- Adding some techniques like 'Data Augmentation' to produce more Data in case of having a limited or lack data.
- Simple explanation and links to some used concepts throughtout the project
