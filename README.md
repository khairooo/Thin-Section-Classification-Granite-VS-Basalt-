# Thin-Section-Classification-Granite-VS-Basalt-

- This project is considered as Combination between Petrography (microscopique) and Deep learning CNN model
- I attempted to make the project legible for Geologists, Geoscientists who want to build a similar project for their thesis our in any other research 
- Adding some techniques like 'Data Augmentation' to produce more Data in case where there is a limited access, or lack of Datasets
- Simple explanation and links to some used concepts throughtout the project
